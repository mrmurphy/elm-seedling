# Elm Seedling

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splodingsocks/elm-seedling/master/hanging-elm-763308_640.jpg)

 - `npm run build` : Builds the elm source to public/built/index.js
 - `npm run watch` : Watches elm files in src for changes, and runs `npm run build` when changes are detected
 - `npm run serve` : Starts up a server in the public directory, and live-reloads when public/built/*.js or public/*.css change

 I recommend opening up a shell with two splits, or two tabs, and running `npm watch` in one, and `npm serve` in another.

The [Bootstrap Material Design](http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/#getting-started) styling and JS are included.
